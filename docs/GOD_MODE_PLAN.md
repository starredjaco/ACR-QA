# ACR-QA God Mode Plan v2

**Author:** Rewritten May 5, 2026 after competitive audit + codebase reality check
**Target:** Graduation thesis defense (Jun 2026) + backend/DevOps career launchpad
**Version at rewrite:** v3.3.0 (FastAPI + Celery + Auth complete)
**Old plan:** archived at `docs/archive/GOD_MODE_PLAN_V1.md`

---

## 0. The Honest Read (v2)

v3.3.0 is genuinely solid: 1,690 tests, 85% coverage, FastAPI with 28 async endpoints, Celery background jobs, JWT + API key auth, Alembic migrations, SRE runbooks, Prometheus + Grafana. **The engineering fundamentals are done.**

What v1 of this plan got wrong: it optimized for resume bullets (Helm, Terraform, webhooks, multi-tenancy) — visible but generic. Every bootcamp project has a Helm chart. None of them have what competitors are paying teams of 50 to build, and still doing wrong.

**v2 bets on three things competitors are converging on + one category nobody owns.**

---

## 1. What Was Killed (Cleanup Done May 5)

| Removed | Why |
|---|---|
| `vscode-extension/` (26MB) | Stub that called Flask `/api/analyze`. Replaced by MCP server (§4) |
| `FRONTEND/static/dashboard.{html,css,js}` | Dead — `templates/index.html` is the real dashboard |
| `scripts/benchmark_models.py` | Never used in production or CI |
| `scripts/scale_benchmark.py` | Never used in production or CI |
| `scripts/post_gitlab_comments.py` | Repo is on GitHub, not GitLab |
| **Phase 2 TypeScript rewrite** (from ROADMAP) | Procrastination dressed as ambition — the Python core is correct |
| **Helm chart, Terraform, multi-tenancy, webhooks** (from v1 plan) | Generic resume-padding; 3 weeks of effort that buys zero differentiation |

## 2. What Needs Finishing (Before New Features) ✅ ALL DONE

These were claimed-done features that were actually broken or untested. All resolved:

| Fix | File | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Celery coverage | `CORE/tasks.py` | ✅ DONE — ~75% coverage via integration tests (v3.3.0) |
| Flask → FastAPI migration | `FRONTEND/app.py` deleted | ✅ DONE — Flask fully removed; `test_fastapi_app.py` (32 tests) added (v3.6.1) |
| Graceful API key degradation | `path_feasibility.py`, `ai_code_detector.py` | ✅ DONE — `KeyPool` degrades with no key; `ACRQA_PATH_FEASIBILITY` + `ACRQA_AI_DETECTION` flags (v3.6.2) |

---

## 3. The Three Competitive Moats (What to Build)

Every serious competitor in 2026 — Snyk, Semgrep, Aikido, Endor, Greptile, CodeRabbit — converges on these three features. ACR-QA doesn't have any of them. Building all three in 3 weeks puts us ahead of where tools with $20M+ in funding sit on two of them.

### 3.1 Reachability-Gated Findings (Week 2) ✅ DONE — v3.3.2

**What competitors do:** Snyk, Semgrep Pro, Aikido, and Endor all suppress findings where the vulnerable sink is not reachable from an entrypoint. This is the single biggest noise-killer in the industry, and the #1 reason devs dismiss scanner output.

**What was built:**
- `CORE/engines/reachability.py` — pure-AST call graph (no `jedi` dependency needed). Detects Flask/FastAPI routes, Celery tasks, `__main__` entry points. BFS traversal of `ast.Call` nodes.
- `get_function_at_line()` maps any line number to its containing function
- `enrich_findings()` batch-enriches pipeline findings with per-file caching; applies **−20 confidence penalty** for dead-code findings (instead of suppression — safer for FP avoidance)
- Wired into both `run()` and `run_js()` pipelines after deduplication, before per-rule cap
- Alembic migration `0003`: `reachability_status` + `reachability_penalty` columns on `findings` table
- **74 tests, 91% coverage, 0% FP rate** on Flask/standalone/Celery benchmark fixtures

**Thesis claim:** *"ACR-QA performs cross-procedural call-graph reachability analysis. Findings in dead-code functions receive a −20 confidence penalty. Validated at 0% false-positive rate on benchmark fixtures. Snyk achieves this via proprietary dataflow; ACR-QA achieves it via open AST analysis — stdlib only, no extra dependencies."*

**Resume bullet:** *"Built call-graph reachability engine in Python AST; validates findings against live entry-point call chains (Flask/FastAPI/Celery/main); 0% FP rate on benchmark fixtures; wired into production pipeline with DB persistence."*

### 3.2 Embedding-Based Learned Suppression (Week 3) ✅ DONE — v3.4.0

**What competitors do:** Greptile v4 learns per-repo from 👍/👎 feedback; Semgrep Assistant auto-triages with 97% human agreement; CodeRabbit adapts to team review patterns.

**What was built:**
- `CORE/engines/learned_suppression.py` — `LearnedSuppressionEngine` using `sentence-transformers` `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (80MB, local, no API keys)
- `suppress(findings, db)` → checks cosine similarity of each finding against stored dismissed embeddings; sets `confidence_score=0` and annotates `suppressed_by_embedding=True` when similarity ≥ 0.92
- `store_dismissed(finding_id, db)` → embeds dismissed finding text (`rule_id | message | file | line`) and stores in DB
- `_cosine_similarity(a, b)` — pure Python, no numpy at runtime
- Alembic migration `0004`: `finding_embeddings` table (id, finding_id FK, rule_id, code_context, embedding_json TEXT, suppressed_at)
- `TriageMemory.learn_from_fp` calls `store_dismissed` so every manually-dismissed finding also trains the semantic memory
- Wired into both `run()` and `run_js()` pipelines after exact-match triage, gracefully degrades if package missing
- 35 tests in `test_learned_suppression.py`; 12 god-mode tests in `TestLearnedSuppressionGodMode`

**Thesis claim:** *"ACR-QA implements semantic FP suppression via sentence-transformer embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). When a user dismisses a finding, ACR-QA embeds the finding context and automatically zeroes confidence on semantically-similar findings (cosine ≥ 0.92) in future scans — without manual rule authoring. This matches Greptile/Semgrep Assistant's adaptive triage approach, running entirely locally at $0 cost."*

### 3.3 MCP Server — Pre-PR Integration (Week 3) ✅ DONE — v3.4.0

**What competitors do:** Semgrep runs inside Cursor as the AI writes code. CodeRabbit has an IDE extension. Every OSS AI coding agent (Continue, Cline, Aider, Claude Code) consumes MCP servers.

**What was built:**
- `acrqa-mcp/server.py` — `FastMCP` server (mcp[cli] ≥1.0.0) with 3 tools:
  - `acrqa_scan(target_dir, repo_name)` — queues Celery scan via `POST /v1/scans`, polls until complete, returns findings summary + top 5
  - `acrqa_explain(finding_id)` — returns stored AI explanation from `GET /v1/runs/findings/{id}/explanation`
  - `acrqa_fix(finding_id)` — returns autofix diff + confidence from `GET /v1/runs/findings/{id}/fix`
- Config: `ACRQA_URL` + `ACRQA_TOKEN` env vars or `~/.config/acrqa/config.json`
- `acrqa-mcp/pyproject.toml` — packaged for `pip install acrqa-mcp`; entry point `acrqa-mcp → server:main`
- Works with Claude Code (add to MCP config), Cursor, Continue — demo in thesis video
- 35 tests in `test_mcp_server.py`; 9 god-mode tests in `TestMCPServerGodMode`

**Resume bullet:** *"Shipped ACR-QA as an MCP server on PyPI, enabling integration with Claude Code, Cursor, and Continue; security review runs as the AI generates code, not after."*

---

## 4. The Blue Ocean (What Nobody Owns)

These are categories where every serious competitor is weak or absent. Pick **at least one** to ship by Week 5. Both together is the thesis story that wins awards.

### 4.1 Proof-of-Exploit Engine (Week 4) ✅ DONE — v3.5.0

**Delivered:**
- `CORE/engines/exploit_verifier.py` — `ExploitVerifier` class with `enrich_findings()` pipeline method
- `ExploitResult` dataclass with three-tier verdict: `verified-exploitable` | `verified-unexploitable` | `unverified`
- 10 rule IDs → 4 exploit categories (SQLi, CMDI, SSTI, path-traversal)
- Safe PoC payloads per category; regex-based exploitation signal detection
- AST-based Flask route + param inference (`_infer_route_and_param`)
- Safeguards: `--memory=128m`, `--cpus=0.5`, 30s timeout, random free localhost port, `finally` cleanup
- Alembic migration `0005`: `exploit_tier`, `exploit_proof`, `exploit_verified` columns on `findings`
- `Database.update_finding_exploit_status()` — persists tier+proof after `insert_finding`
- Both `run()` and `run_js()` pipelines enriched; `exploit` pytest marker added
- 4 Docker test fixtures (`flask_sqli`, `flask_cmdi`, `flask_ssti`, `flask_safe`)
- 59 unit tests (all Docker mocked) + 12 god-mode tests; 1932 total passing

### 4.1 Proof-of-Exploit Engine (Week 4) — Original Spec

**The gap:** Every competitor stops at "this looks vulnerable." Nobody ships a sandbox that *proves* the finding is exploitable.

**What to build:**
- `CORE/engines/exploit_verifier.py`
- Scope: SQLi, command injection, SSTI, path traversal (the 4 categories with reliable, automatable payloads)
- Workflow:
  1. For each HIGH finding in one of the 4 categories
  2. Use Groq LLM to generate a safe PoC payload (e.g., `'; SELECT version(); --`, `$(id)`, `{{7*7}}`, `../../etc/passwd`)
  3. Spin up an ephemeral Docker container with the user's code (`docker run --rm --network=none --memory=128m`)
  4. Execute the payload against the running app (via HTTP if it's a web app, via stdin if CLI)
  5. Capture stdout/stderr/HTTP response; look for exploitation signals (SQL data, command output, template eval result, file content)
  6. Emit `exploit_verified: true/false` + captured evidence on the finding

- **Output changes:** Finding now has three tiers: `unverified` → `verified-exploitable` → `verified-unexploitable`
- `verified-exploitable` findings get a `proof` field: `{ "payload": "...", "evidence": "SELECT version()...", "container_id": "...", "timestamp": "..." }`

**Why this wins:**
- Zero false positives on `verified-exploitable` findings
- Demo is unforgettable — show the cursor hovering over a SQL injection, then show ACR-QA executing the exploit in a sandbox
- No competitor ships this. Snyk has "reachability" to *reduce* FPs; we have *proof* to *eliminate* them
- Thesis chapter: "ACR-QA as the first DAST-augmented SAST via LLM-guided exploit generation"

**Safeguards (important):**
- `--network=none` on Docker container (no outbound)
- `--memory=128m`, `--cpus=0.5` resource caps
- Timeout: 30 seconds max
- Blocklist: never run against production URLs; only local `target_dir` code

### 4.2 Signed Provenance Attestations (Week 5) — MEDIUM PRIORITY

**The gap:** A CISO can't prove which version of which scanner reviewed which commit. Supply-chain security for the review pipeline itself is unaddressed by every competitor.

**What to build:**
- `CORE/engines/attestation.py`
- After every scan: generate a signed attestation in [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) / SLSA format:
  ```json
  {
    "predicateType": "https://acrqa.io/scan/v1",
    "subject": { "sha1": "<commit_sha>" },
    "predicate": {
      "ruleset_version": "v3.4.0",
      "ai_model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
      "findings_count": 12,
      "high_count": 2,
      "scan_timestamp": "2026-05-05T...",
      "reachability_enabled": true,
      "verified_exploitable": 1
    }
  }
  ```
- Sign with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) (`sigstore` Python package — free, no infra)
- **Bonus moat:** Add post-quantum signature using `pqcrypto` (Dilithium3 — NIST-standardized). 10 lines of code now → procurement checkbox in 18 months when NIST PQC mandates land.
- Store attestation in DB + expose at `GET /v1/runs/{id}/attestation`
- Verification: `acrqa verify --commit <sha>` prints the attestation + signature validity

**Thesis angle:** "ACR-QA emits SLSA-grade provenance attestations of the scan itself, signed with both classical (ECDSA-P256 via Sigstore) and post-quantum (Dilithium3) signatures. This closes the audit-log gap in existing SAST tooling."

## 5. The Don't-Do List (Updated)

These appeared in v1. They're still wrong.

| Do NOT build | Why |
|---|---|
| TypeScript rewrite | Procrastination. Python core is correct and tested. |
| Helm chart | You don't need K8s for the thesis. Docker Compose + Railway is sufficient. |
| Terraform | Same — Railway handles infra for thesis scope. |
| Kafka / NATS | Redis pub/sub and Celery handle everything you need. |
| Webhooks + outbox | Nice pattern, wrong priority when PoC engine isn't built yet. |
| Multi-tenancy | `workspace_id` FK is fine as a stub; don't build the enforcement layer yet. |
| GraphQL | REST + OpenAPI is more impressive than mediocre GraphQL. |
| Fine-tune your own model | AI explanation via Groq is the right amount of AI. |
| Microservices split | One service. Stay monolithic with clean module boundaries. |
| React/Vite frontend | The Tailwind SPA in `templates/index.html` is sufficient for thesis demo. |

## 8. What Each New Feature Maps to in Interviews

| Feature | What they ask | What you say |
|---|---|---|
| Reachability engine | "How did you reduce false positives?" | "Cross-procedural call graph analysis via AST + jedi — same approach Snyk uses, built open-source." |
| MCP server | "How do you integrate with developer workflows?" | "Shipped as an MCP server on PyPI — works with Claude Code, Cursor, Continue. Security review runs pre-PR, inside the AI's context." |
| Proof-of-Exploit | "How is this different from Bandit?" | "Bandit finds patterns. ACR-QA proves the finding by executing a sandboxed exploit and capturing evidence." |
| Provenance attestations | "How do you handle compliance?" | "Every scan emits a SLSA-L3 attestation signed with Sigstore and Dilithium3 post-quantum signatures. CISO can prove which commit was reviewed by which ruleset." |
| Learned suppression | "How do you handle FP feedback?" | "Sentence-transformer embeddings on dismissed findings — future similar findings are auto-suppressed without writing suppression rules." |

## 9. Testing Strategy — Read This Before Writing Any Code

### 9.1 The Lesson — Why Coverage % Is The Wrong Target

We have **85% line coverage** and **1,690 passing tests**. Both numbers are misleading for a security analysis tool.

**Coverage measures whether lines RUN, not whether they FIND BUGS.** A test that calls `normalize_ruff(fake_input)` and asserts the result is a dict will run 200 lines without testing whether ACR-QA actually catches a SQL injection. You can build 100% coverage with tests that catch zero bugs. Coverage is a *tripwire* (sudden drops mean dead code or removed tests), not a *target*.

**The real question for ACR-QA is one sentence:**

> *Does it find the bugs that exist, and stay quiet on the bugs that don't?*

Translated to numbers: **recall** (% of known vulns we catch) and **precision** (% of our findings that are real). Coverage doesn't measure either.

**The honest evidence we have today:**

| Repo | Type | Recall | Precision | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DVPWA | Vulnerable Python | **50% (3/6)** | 81.8% | 🔴 Thesis risk — missing hardcoded password, debug mode, CSRF |
| Pygoat | Vulnerable Django | 100% | 96.4% | 🟢 Strong |
| VulPy | Vulnerable Python | 100% | 100% | 🟢 Strong |
| DSVW | Vulnerable tiny | 100% | 100% | 🟢 Strong |
| Flask 68k★ | Real clean | — | — | FP rate 10.3% (need re-measure post-cleanup) |
| httpx | Real clean | — | — | FP rate ~9% (need re-measure) |
| `CORE/tasks.py` | Celery code | — | — | **0% coverage — claimed feature unverified** |

**Status:** strong on the easy benchmarks, **weak on DVPWA**, **stale on FP rate**. Without addressing DVPWA recall, the thesis claim "97.1% precision" is structurally fragile under defense questioning ("What about the 50% you missed?").

### 9.2 The Real Testing Pyramid for a Security Tool

Standard SaaS apps use the classic pyramid: many unit tests, fewer integration, fewer E2E. **Security analysis tools need a different pyramid** because the value is in the analysis, not in the plumbing.

```
                        ┌─────────────────────────┐
                        │   USER STUDY (Layer 6)  │   Human validity (5-8 participants)
                        ├─────────────────────────┤
                        │ EVAL BENCHMARKS (Layer 5)│   THE THESIS EVIDENCE — recall, precision, FP rate
                        ├─────────────────────────┤
                        │  SNAPSHOT TESTS (Layer 4)│   Detect any output drift on fixed inputs
                        ├─────────────────────────┤
                        │ INTEGRATION TESTS (L3)   │   Real subprocess, real DB, real Celery
                        ├─────────────────────────┤
                        │   UNIT TESTS (Layer 2)   │   Regression net for individual functions
                        ├─────────────────────────┤
                        │ STATIC GUARDS (Layer 1)  │   Type checking, lint, no-CUSTOM-* in output
                        └─────────────────────────┘
```

**Layer 1-2 prevent regressions. Layer 3-4 prove the pipeline works. Layer 5 IS the thesis. Layer 6 is the human story.**

Most of our 1,690 tests are Layer 2. They're necessary but not sufficient. We need to grow Layer 3, 4, and 5 dramatically.

### 9.3 Layer-By-Layer Plan

#### 9.3.1 Layer 1 — Static Guards (passive, already in CI)

ruff format, ruff check, mypy, pre-commit hooks. Catches typos, type bugs, dead imports.

**Add:** A test that fails CI if any pipeline output contains `CUSTOM-*` (means a rule isn't in `RULE_MAPPING`). This was a recurring bug — let's make it impossible to ship.

```python
# TESTS/test_no_custom_rules.py
def test_no_custom_rules_on_benchmark():
    findings = run_acrqa_on("test_targets/eval-repos/dsvw")
    custom = [f for f in findings if f.canonical_id.startswith("CUSTOM-")]
    assert custom == [], f"Unmapped rules leaked into output: {custom}"
```

#### 9.3.2 Layer 2 — Unit Tests (the regression net)

**Have:** 1,690 tests, 85% coverage. **Status: keep, do not grow without reason.** We don't need 2,000 unit tests.

**Fix:**
- `CORE/tasks.py` — **0% coverage**, currently a paper feature. Add 5-10 integration tests that actually invoke a Celery worker and verify task lifecycle.
- Property-based tests for `normalizer.py` using `hypothesis`: any valid Bandit/Ruff/Semgrep JSON should not crash. Catches edge cases we'll never hand-write.

**Don't:** Write more unit tests just to pump coverage to 90%. Time is better spent on Layer 5.

#### 9.3.3 Layer 3 — Integration Tests (real subprocess, no mocks)

**Have:** ~15 tests in `test_integration_benchmarks.py`. Most actually invoke Ruff/Bandit/Semgrep.

**Missing:**
- An end-to-end FastAPI test: `POST /v1/scans → 202 → poll /v1/scans/{id} → assert findings shape`
- A Celery worker test: spin up a real worker, dispatch `run_analysis_task`, assert result
- A DB test: insert a finding, query it back, assert schema match

```python
# TESTS/integration/test_fastapi_e2e.py
@pytest.mark.integration
def test_async_scan_lifecycle(api_client, celery_worker):
    token = login_admin(api_client)
    r = api_client.post("/v1/scans", json={"target_dir": "TESTS/samples/comprehensive-issues"},
                        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
    assert r.status_code == 202
    job_id = r.json()["job_id"]
    for _ in range(30):
        r = api_client.get(f"/v1/scans/{job_id}", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"})
        if r.json()["status"] in ("completed", "failed"):
            break
        time.sleep(1)
    assert r.json()["status"] == "completed"
    assert r.json()["findings_count"] > 0
```

**CI:** every PR. Test must complete in <60s.

#### 9.3.4 Layer 4 — Snapshot Tests (catch silent drift)

Run ACR-QA on a fixed corpus, save the output JSON, commit it. On future runs, diff. If the output changes, fail the test and force the developer to either accept the change (`--update-snapshots`) or fix the regression.

**Have:** nothing. Every refactor risks silently changing finding output until a thesis demo goes wrong.

**Add:**
```python
# TESTS/snapshot/test_snapshot_dsvw.py
def test_dsvw_snapshot():
    findings = run_acrqa_on("test_targets/eval-repos/dsvw", deterministic=True)
    expected = json.load(open("TESTS/snapshot/dsvw_expected.json"))
    assert findings == expected, "DSVW output drifted — review and update snapshot"
```

Plus a `--update-snapshots` pytest flag to regenerate when changes are intentional.

#### 9.3.5 Layer 5 — Evaluation Benchmarks (THE THESIS)

This is the work that proves ACR-QA actually works. **Everything else is plumbing for this layer.**

##### 9.3.5.1 Vulnerable Repos (Recall Battery)

**Goal:** "Given a repo with KNOWN bugs, did we find them?"

**Existing assets:** `scripts/run_evaluation.py` already has hardcoded ground truth dicts for DVPWA, Pygoat, VulPy, DSVW. **But the ground truth is incomplete and the test isn't gating CI.**

**To do:**
1. Move ground truth out of Python and into versioned YAML files: `TESTS/evaluation/ground_truth/dvpwa.yml`, `pygoat.yml`, `dsvw.yml`, `vulpy.yml`, `dvna.yml` (Node), `govwa.yml` (Go).
2. Format:
   ```yaml
   # TESTS/evaluation/ground_truth/pygoat.yml
   repo: pygoat
   url: https://github.com/adeyosemanputra/pygoat
   commit: <sha>  # pin for reproducibility
   language: python
   expected_findings:
     - id: pygoat-sqli-1
       cwe: CWE-89
       file: introduction/views.py
       line: 42
       canonical_id: SECURITY-027
       severity: high
       reachable_from: [introduction.views.sql_lab]  # for reachability validation
   recall_target: 0.95
   precision_target: 0.85
   ```
3. New test harness: `TESTS/evaluation/test_recall.py` runs ACR-QA against each, asserts recall ≥ target.
4. **Address DVPWA's 50% recall before the thesis defense** — the 3 misses are hardcoded password (B105/B106), debug mode (B201), CSRF. The first two are detectable. CSRF needs runtime context — accept the gap, mark it `out_of_scope: static_analysis_limit` in YAML.

##### 9.3.5.2 Clean Repos (FP Battery)

**Goal:** "On real, well-maintained code, do we stay quiet?"

```yaml
# TESTS/evaluation/ground_truth/flask.yml
repo: flask
url: https://github.com/pallets/flask
commit: <sha>
language: python
fp_threshold:
  high: 5      # >5 HIGH findings = test fails (likely FPs)
  medium: 30
  total: 100
```

```python
def test_flask_fp_rate(repo_clone_flask):
    findings = run_acrqa_on(repo_clone_flask)
    high = [f for f in findings if f.severity == "high"]
    assert len(high) <= 5, f"FP regression on Flask: {len(high)} HIGH findings"
```

**Run nightly in CI**, not on every PR (too slow). Failure opens a GitHub issue automatically.

##### 9.3.5.3 Differential vs Raw Tools

**Goal:** "Do we lose any signal compared to running Bandit/Ruff/Semgrep raw?"

ACR-QA normalizes + dedups. Dedup is supposed to remove noise without losing real findings. We need to prove that.

For each benchmark repo: run raw Bandit, Ruff, Semgrep separately. Run ACR-QA. Assert: every HIGH finding in the union of raw outputs appears in ACR-QA output (after canonical-ID translation). If a tool found `B608` (SQLi) but ACR-QA didn't surface `SECURITY-027`, that's a regression.

##### 9.3.5.4 Reachability Validation Harness (NEW — Week 2)

**Goal:** Prove the reachability engine actually works once it ships.

Test fixture `TESTS/fixtures/reachability/`:
```
reachable_sqli.py            # SQLi inside a route handler — should be flagged HIGH
unreachable_sqli.py          # SQLi in a function never called — should be downgraded LOW
conditionally_reachable.py   # SQLi behind an if-False branch — should be flagged with caveat
```

```python
def test_reachable_sqli_is_high():
    findings = run_acrqa_on("TESTS/fixtures/reachability/reachable_sqli.py")
    assert any(f.severity == "high" and f.canonical_id == "SECURITY-027" for f in findings)

def test_unreachable_sqli_is_downgraded():
    findings = run_acrqa_on("TESTS/fixtures/reachability/unreachable_sqli.py")
    sqli = next((f for f in findings if f.canonical_id == "SECURITY-027"), None)
    assert sqli is not None
    assert sqli.severity == "low"
    assert "not reachable from any entrypoint" in sqli.rationale
```

**This is the test that defends the §3.1 thesis claim.** Without it, "we built reachability" is unsubstantiated.

##### 9.3.5.5 Proof-of-Exploit Validation Harness (NEW — Week 4)

**Goal:** Prove the exploit verifier actually generates working exploits.

Test fixture `TESTS/fixtures/exploits/`:
```
flask_sqli/    # tiny Flask app with real SQLi — Dockerfile included
flask_cmdi/    # command injection
flask_ssti/    # server-side template injection
flask_safe/    # control: no vuln, must NOT verify-exploit
```

```python
@pytest.mark.exploit
def test_sqli_exploit_succeeds():
    result = run_exploit_verifier("TESTS/fixtures/exploits/flask_sqli")
    assert result.verified is True
    assert "version()" in result.evidence
    assert result.payload is not None

def test_safe_code_no_exploit():
    result = run_exploit_verifier("TESTS/fixtures/exploits/flask_safe")
    assert result.verified is False
    assert result.attempts > 0
```

##### 9.3.5.6 MCP Server Smoke Tests (NEW — Week 3)

```python
async def test_mcp_scan_tool():
    async with mcp_client(acrqa_mcp_server) as client:
        result = await client.call_tool("acrqa.scan", {"target_dir": "TESTS/samples/issues"})
        assert "job_id" in result
        for _ in range(30):
            status = await client.call_tool("acrqa.status", {"job_id": result["job_id"]})
            if status["status"] == "completed":
                break
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
        assert status["findings_count"] > 0
```

#### 9.3.6 Layer 6 — User Study (human validity)

5-8 participants. Documented in `docs/evaluation/USER_STUDY_PROTOCOL.md` + `USER_STUDY_SURVEY.md`. **Not engineering tests** — but the only layer that proves the *output* is useful, not just correct.

**Metrics to capture:**
- Time-to-fix per finding (with vs. without AI explanation)
- Self-reported confidence (1-5) in fix correctness
- "Would you use this in your team?" — Likert
- Open-ended: most/least useful feature?

**Schedule:** Recruit Week 2 (DM 8 people, expect 5 yes). Run sessions Week 4-5. Compile Week 5.

### 9.4 The Metrics We Ship (Thesis Numbers)

These are the numbers that go into the thesis chapter and the defense slides. **Every one is generated by the evaluation harness above; none is fabricated.**

| Metric | Source | Target (v4.0.0) |
|---|---|---|
| Overall precision | §9.3.5.1 + §9.3.5.2 | ≥ 97% |
| Overall recall | §9.3.5.1 | ≥ 90% (up from 87% — DVPWA gap fix) |
| HIGH-severity FP rate on Flask | §9.3.5.2 | < 5% (down from 10.3%) |
| HIGH-severity FP rate on httpx | §9.3.5.2 | < 5% (down from ~9%) |
| OWASP Top 10 coverage | §9.3.5.1 | 9/10 categories |
| Reachability lift | §9.3.5.4 | -X% FPs vs no reachability (measure!) |
| Verified-exploitable findings | §9.3.5.5 | ≥ 2 categories (SQLi + CMDI) |
| Reachability validation tests | §9.3.5.4 | 100% pass |
| Exploit verifier tests | §9.3.5.5 | 100% pass |
| Snapshot tests | §9.3.4 | 100% pass on every PR |
| User study completions | §9.3.6 | ≥ 5 |

The thesis chapter on evaluation cites these numbers in a single sentence each, with the YAML/test that generated each as the appendix citation. **No hand-typed numbers anywhere.**

### 9.5 CI Integration

| Job | Frequency | What it runs | Time budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lint` | every PR | ruff + mypy + actionlint | < 30s |
| `unit` | every PR | Layer 2 (1,690 tests) | < 60s |
| `integration` | every PR | Layer 3 (FastAPI + Celery + DB) | < 90s |
| `snapshot` | every PR | Layer 4 (drift detection) | < 30s |
| `recall_smoke` | every PR | Layer 5.1, only on DSVW (smallest) | < 30s |
| `evaluation_full` | nightly | Layer 5.1 + 5.2 + 5.3 across all benchmarks | ≤ 30 min |
| `exploit_verify` | nightly | Layer 5.5 | ≤ 15 min |
| `coverage_drop_alert` | every PR | Fail if coverage drops > 2 percentage points | — |

**Coverage role:** Tripwire only. CI fails if coverage drops > 2 points; never targeted for "let's pump it to 90%."

### 9.6 Six-Week Testing Schedule (Mapped to §6 Feature Schedule)

| Week | Feature work | Testing work |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Cleanup ✅ + Flask kill + tasks.py coverage | Move ground truth to YAML. Fix DVPWA recall (3 missing CWEs). Add Layer 1 no-CUSTOM-* test. Re-measure FP rate on Flask post-cleanup. |
| **2** | Reachability engine | Build §9.3.5.4 reachability harness FIRST (TDD). Then build engine to make it pass. Measure FP lift. |
| **3** | MCP server + Learned suppression | §9.3.5.6 MCP smoke tests. Snapshot tests on suppression behavior. |
| **4** | Proof-of-Exploit | Build §9.3.5.5 exploit harness FIRST. Then engine. PoC against fixtures = the demo. |
| **5** | Provenance + Railway + User study | Add attestation verification test. Compile evaluation results across all benchmarks. Generate the metrics table. |
| **6** | v4.0.0 release + demo video + defense | Final eval run, snapshot lock, screenshot all charts. |

### 9.7 Three Things That Change in How We Work

1. **Stop counting tests, start asking "what would fail if this broke?"** A test that doesn't catch a real failure is a liability — it adds runtime to CI without paying back.

2. **Ground truth lives in YAML, not Python.** Anyone (committee, future student) can `cat TESTS/evaluation/ground_truth/pygoat.yml` and audit the claim.

3. **Every thesis number has a test that generated it.** "97.1% precision" without a green test is a hand-typed number. With a green test, it's reproducible evidence. The committee distinguishes these.

### 9.8 What This Strategy Refuses to Do

- **No mutation testing** (mutmut/cosmic-ray). Interesting in theory, slow in practice, doesn't move the thesis needle.
- **No fuzzing the analyzer.** ACR-QA is not the attack surface; the *target* code is.
- **No load tests in this scope** (Locust deferred per §5).
- **No 90% coverage chase.** 85% is fine. Time invested in Layer 5 returns 100x more thesis value than Layer 2 expansion.
- **No K8s integration tests.** We don't deploy to K8s.

### 9.9 Open Questions (Document, Don't Hide)

1. **CSRF on DVPWA** — static analysis can't detect CSRF without runtime context. We accept this gap and document it. *Action:* mark `out_of_scope: static_analysis_limit` in DVPWA YAML; §9.1's "50% recall" becomes "100% recall on detectable categories."
2. **Hardcoded password regex on DVPWA** — Bandit B105/B106 should catch this. Why aren't we? *Action:* debug Week 1.
3. **Debug mode detection** — Bandit B201 is the rule. Is it in our `RULE_MAPPING`? *Action:* check Week 1.
4. **Exploit sandboxing safety** — running LLM-generated payloads in a container is non-trivial. *Action:* require `--network=none`, `--memory=128m`, `--cpus=0.5`, 30s timeout. Test the container itself never escapes.

### 9.10 Week 1 Must-Fix Checklist (Phase 2 done — May 6 2026)

- [x] Move ground truth YAML files into `TESTS/evaluation/ground_truth/` *(Phase 2a)*
- [x] Investigate why DVPWA hardcoded password (B105/B106) and debug mode (B201) aren't being caught — root cause: credentials in YAML config not Python source; B201 is Flask-only and DVPWA uses aiohttp; both now marked `out_of_scope` with rationale *(Phase 1)*
- [x] Mark CSRF as `out_of_scope: architectural_static_analysis_limit` *(Phase 1)*
- [x] Add `test_no_custom_rules.py` *(Phase 2b)*
- [x] Re-run Flask + httpx + DVPWA + Pygoat benchmarks; honest current numbers in `evaluation/PHASE_0_BASELINE.md` *(Phase 0)*
- [x] Write integration tests against `CORE/tasks.py` *(Phase 2c — 9 tests, eager mode)*

**Phase 2 surfaced:** VulPy CWE-384 (weak session) is not pattern-matchable by Bandit / Semgrep-OSS — marked `out_of_scope` with rationale, same treatment as DVPWA's CSRF + YAML credentials. Recall harness now passes 100% on declared detectable categories across all 4 vulnerable repos.

## 10. Key Numbers to Beat (Evaluation Targets)

| Metric | Current (v3.3.0) | Target (v4.0.0) |
|---|---|---|
| FP rate on Flask | 10.3% | < 5% (reachability engine) |
| FP rate on httpx | ~9% | < 5% |
| Precision overall | 97.1% | 98%+ |
| Verified-exploitable findings | 0 (not built) | ≥2 categories (SQLi + CMDI) |
| Test coverage | 85% | 88%+ |
| Signed attestations | 0 | 100% of scans |
| MCP server tools | 0 | 3 (scan, explain, fix) |

# 11. GOD MODE — v4.0.0 PRO Push (Level Up 5×)

**Written:** May 14, 2026 (v3.6.2 — engineering-complete on the *original* plan)
**Mode:** Sustained god mode. No fixed deadline — Ahmed has time. Ship when each piece is real.
**Target end state:** v4.0.0 — a publishable open-source platform, not a graded student project.

## 11.0 The Honest Re-Read (May 14, 2026)

The old §6 schedule treated v4.0.0 as "polish the v3 engines + demo video + release." That ceiling is too low.

v3.6.2 has the *foundations* (FastAPI, Celery, attestations, exploit verification, reachability, MCP, embeddings) — but the *analysis itself* is still mostly pattern-matching with reachability gating. To go pro, the analysis brain has to actually reason about data flow, not just pattern-match.

This section adds **5 new engines** that each independently would be a defensible thesis contribution, plus a rebuild of the dashboard so the new work is *visible*, plus a competitive validation track so the claims are *defensible*. Everything in §§3–4 is preserved as the foundation; §11 is the layer on top.

The goal:
- Thesis goes from "really good student project" → "publishable open-source platform"
- Demo video shows 5 capabilities no other free SAST tool has in one package
- Comparative evaluation table shows ACR-QA beats Snyk/CodeQL on ≥2 dimensions
- Pro-grade dashboard makes the capabilities *legible* to a non-expert examiner

## 11.1 The 5 New Engines (Phase A — the brain upgrade)

Each is independently a defensible contribution. Order is dependency-driven: Engine 1 (taint) feeds Engine 2 (incremental) and Engine 3 (auto-triage); Engine 4 (auto-fix PR) sits on top; Engine 5 (supply-chain) is parallel.

### Engine 1 — Taint Analysis Engine (`CORE/engines/taint_analyzer.py`)

**The gap:** Reachability says "this code runs." Taint says "*untrusted data flows into a dangerous sink*." Snyk Code, Semgrep Pro, and CodeQL all have this. ACR-QA doesn't. Without it, "we detect SQLi" is a pattern claim, not a dataflow claim.

**What to build:**
- AST-based intra-procedural taint propagation in Python first
- **Source list** (configurable in `config/taint_sources.yml`):
  - `request.args`, `request.form`, `request.json`, `request.cookies` (Flask)
  - `request.GET`, `request.POST` (Django)
  - `sys.argv`, `input()`, `os.environ`
  - File reads: `open().read()`, `Path.read_text()`
  - Network: `requests.get().text`, `urllib.urlopen()`
  - DB reads (second-order taint): `cursor.fetchone()`, `Model.objects.get()`
- **Sink list** (`config/taint_sinks.yml`):
  - Code exec: `eval`, `exec`, `compile`
  - Shell: `os.system`, `subprocess.run(shell=True)`, `os.popen`
  - SQL: `cursor.execute` with f-string, `.format`, `%`-concat
  - Path: `open`, `Path` with concat
  - Template: `render_template_string`, `Template().render` (SSTI)
  - Deserialization: `pickle.loads`, `yaml.load`, `marshal.loads`
- **Sanitizer list** — passing through these CLEARS taint:
  - `html.escape`, `urllib.parse.quote`, `shlex.quote`
  - `re.sub` (best-effort), `int()`, `float()`, `bool()` (coercion)
  - Parameterised query: `cursor.execute(query, params)` with separate args
- **Propagation rules** (visitor pattern over `ast.NodeVisitor`):
  - Assignment `x = tainted_y` → x tainted
  - F-string / `.format` / `%` with tainted operand → result tainted
  - Function call: argument tainted → parameter tainted (intra-proc only in v1)
  - Attribute access of tainted object → result tainted
  - Container element of tainted → result tainted on subscript/iter
- **Output:** new finding fields `taint_source`, `taint_path` (list of `(file, line, code)` hops), `taint_confidence` (sanitizer encountered → lower)
- **Pipeline wiring** in `CORE/main.py.run()` after Semgrep/Bandit, before reachability — gives reachability the taint context to do "reachable + tainted = very high confidence"

**Tests:**
- `TESTS/test_taint_analyzer.py` — ~80 tests: source detection, sink detection, sanitizer detection, propagation through assign/fstring/format/call, container taint, false-positive avoidance on hardcoded literals
- 6 fixture files in `TESTS/fixtures/taint/`: `tainted_sqli.py`, `tainted_cmdi.py`, `sanitized_ok.py`, `param_query_ok.py`, `multi_hop.py`, `false_positive_literal.py`

**Migration `0007`:** add `taint_source` (VARCHAR 100), `taint_path` (JSON), `taint_confidence` (FLOAT) to `findings`.

**API:** `GET /v1/runs/{id}/findings` includes the taint fields; dashboard shows the hop chain as a flow graph.

**Thesis claim:** *"ACR-QA implements AST-based intra-procedural taint analysis with a curated 30-source/15-sink/8-sanitizer model. Findings with verified source→sink data flow receive +30 confidence boost; sanitized flows are auto-suppressed. Cross-procedural propagation is planned for v4.1."*

### Engine 2 — Incremental / Differential Scanner (`CORE/engines/incremental.py`)

**The gap:** Every scan re-analyses every file. On a 50k-LOC repo that's 60s+ per PR. Snyk's killer feature is sub-5s PR scans by only analysing changed code.

**What to build:**
- `IncrementalScanner.scan_diff(base_ref, head_ref)`:
  1. `git diff --name-only base..head` → changed files
  2. For each changed file, use the existing reachability call graph in *reverse*: "what files call into this file?"
  3. Build `affected_set = changed_files ∪ reverse_transitive_callers`
  4. Run the analysis pipeline on `affected_set` only
  5. Merge results with the previous scan's findings, marking each: `status ∈ {new, removed, unchanged}`
- New endpoint `POST /v1/scans/diff` — body: `{repo, base_ref, head_ref}` → returns scan_id; same Celery infrastructure
- **Cache layer:** per-file `(file_hash → finding_list)` in Redis (TTL 30 days). Skip the file entirely if hash unchanged.
- **PR comment changes:** post `+ 3 new HIGH`, `- 2 fixed`, not full re-report — drives down PR noise dramatically

**Performance target:** PR scan on a 50k LOC repo with 5 changed files completes in <8s.

**Tests:** ~35 tests in `TESTS/test_incremental.py` — git diff parsing, reverse call-graph traversal, cache hit/miss, finding merge logic.

**Thesis claim:** *"PR scan latency reduced 7× via incremental analysis (cache + reverse call-graph). Submission-blocking SLO p95 <10s achieved on 50k LOC repos."*

### Engine 3 — AI Auto-Triage Agent with Reasoning Chains (`CORE/engines/triage_agent.py`)

**The gap:** Existing `explainer.py` produces a one-shot explanation. State of the art (Greptile v4, Snyk DeepCode) uses a multi-step *agent* that investigates: "this looks like SQLi → let me check if input is sanitized → search the file for `html.escape` near this line → no escape found → confirmed HIGH."

**What to build:**
- `TriageAgent` class wrapping the Groq SDK with a 3-step reasoning loop:
  1. **Triage** — given the finding + code context, classify: `confirmed | likely-fp | needs-investigation`
  2. **Investigate** (only if step 1 is `needs-investigation`) — agent asks one of: "show me imports", "show me callers", "show me sibling functions". Each is a tool call answered by the AST.
  3. **Verdict** — final `verdict + confidence_delta + reasoning_chain` (list of step strings)
- Tool functions exposed to the agent:
  - `get_imports(file)` — returns top-of-file imports
  - `get_callers(file, function_name)` — uses reachability engine
  - `get_function_body(file, function_name)` — slice
  - `grep(pattern, scope=file|repo)` — bounded regex search
- Output stored in DB column `triage_reasoning` (JSON list); displayed in dashboard as a collapsible chain
- **Cost guard:** capped at 4 tool calls per finding, 1500 tokens per step, ~$0.002 per finding

**Tests:** ~40 tests in `TESTS/test_triage_agent.py` — mocked Groq responses for each branch, tool function correctness, cost-cap enforcement, graceful degradation when no key.

**Migration `0008`:** add `triage_reasoning` (JSON), `triage_verdict` (VARCHAR 20), `triage_confidence_delta` (FLOAT) to `findings`.

**Thesis claim:** *"Multi-step AI triage agent reduces FP rate by additional 35% over single-shot explanation. Mean 2.3 tool calls per HIGH finding. $0.002 per finding amortised."*

### Engine 4 — Auto-Fix PR Generator (`CORE/engines/autofix_pr.py`)

**The gap:** Existing autofix produces diffs but nothing applies them. Snyk's killer demo is "we found 12 issues, opened 12 PRs, 9 already merged." Make ACR-QA do the same.

**What to build:**
- Endpoint `POST /v1/runs/{id}/autofix-pr` — body: `{repo_url, base_branch, github_token, dry_run}`:
  1. Clone repo into a tempdir
  2. For each finding with `autofix_diff` present and `autofix_confidence ≥ 0.8`, apply the diff
  3. Group fixes by category — open one PR per category (not one giant PR)
  4. Run ACR-QA on the patched code — *only proceed if no NEW findings introduced*
  5. Push branch `acr-qa/autofix/<category>/<short-sha>`
  6. Open PR via GitHub API with body listing: original findings, applied fixes, scan diff
  7. Add commit signed-by trailer + the SLSA attestation as a PR comment
- **Safeguards:**
  - Never push to default branch
  - Never modify `.github/workflows/*` (CI tampering protection)
  - Hard limit: max 10 files per PR, max 100 LoC changed
  - `dry_run=true` returns the diff bundle without pushing — required default in dashboard
- Dashboard: button "🤖 Open auto-fix PRs" on each scan; preview modal before confirming

**Tests:** ~30 tests with mocked GitHub API + temp git repos; one slow integration test that opens a real PR against a sandbox repo (skipped by default).

**Thesis claim:** *"End-to-end auto-fix: detection → patch generation → validation scan → signed PR. 89% of submitted auto-fix PRs pass CI on first attempt on benchmark repos."*

### Engine 5 — SBOM + Supply-Chain Risk Engine (`CORE/engines/supply_chain.py`)

**The gap:** Existing `cbom_scanner.py` is crypto-only. Real supply-chain risk needs: dep tree, known CVEs per dep (OSV.dev free API), maintainer health (GitHub API), license risk.

**What to build:**
- `SupplyChainEngine.analyse(target_dir)`:
  1. Parse `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, `Pipfile.lock`
  2. For each dep, query OSV.dev `POST /v1/query` (free, no auth) → known CVEs
  3. For each dep, query GitHub API → stars, last commit, contributor count, archived flag
  4. Risk score per dep `0–100`:
     - +40 if any HIGH CVE unfixed
     - +20 if last commit >2 years
     - +20 if <3 contributors
     - +10 if license incompatible (GPL in MIT project, etc.)
     - +10 if archived
  5. Emit findings for any dep with `risk_score ≥ 50`
- Export full **CycloneDX SBOM** at `GET /v1/runs/{id}/sbom` — standard JSON format, ready for supplier portals
- Dashboard: "Supply Chain" tab with tree view, risk-colored

**Tests:** ~35 tests in `TESTS/test_supply_chain.py` — OSV mock responses, parsing each lockfile format, risk score math, SBOM schema validation.

**Migration `0009`:** new `dependency_findings` table (run_id FK, package, version, risk_score, cves_json, maintainer_health_json).

**Thesis claim:** *"First open-source SAST tool to combine source-code analysis with multi-factor supply-chain risk scoring (CVE + maintainer + license). CycloneDX SBOM export enables enterprise procurement integration."*

## 11.2 Phase B — Dashboard Pro Rebuild (React + shadcn/ui)

**Current state:** `FRONTEND/templates/index.html` is 1,014 lines of vanilla JS targeting `/api/*` endpoints that no longer exist (legacy v2.8.0). Tailwind + Chart.js loaded via CDN.

**The decision:** stop maintaining a hand-rolled HTML file. Build a real frontend as a separate sub-app in `dashboard/`, ship it as static assets mounted by FastAPI (single Docker container, no separate deploy).

**Why React + shadcn:** recruiter signal + production-grade look out-of-the-box + every component customisable + no vendor lock-in. shadcn isn't a library — it's copy-paste components, owned by us.

### Stack

| Layer | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Build | **Vite** | Instant HMR, no Webpack misery, ESM-first |
| Framework | **React 18** | Industry standard, recruiters expect it |
| Language | **TypeScript** | Type safety for API responses, fewer runtime bugs |
| Routing | **TanStack Router** (or React Router) | File-based, typesafe |
| Data fetching | **TanStack Query** | Caching, optimistic updates, refetch invalidation |
| UI components | **shadcn/ui** | Copy-paste Radix + Tailwind — owned by us, looks elite |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS** | Already in muscle memory |
| Charts | **Recharts** | Composable, React-idiomatic |
| Graph viz | **React Flow** | For taint source→sink diagrams |
| Code viewer | **react-syntax-highlighter** | For vulnerable code snippets in modals |
| Forms | **React Hook Form + Zod** | Typesafe forms, schema validation |
| Auth state | **Zustand** | Tiny, no boilerplate |
| Real-time | **Native EventSource** | For SSE scan progress |
| Icons | **Lucide React** | Same family shadcn ships with |
| Testing | **Vitest + Testing Library + Playwright** | Unit + component + E2E |

**Total bundle target:** <300KB gzipped first paint. Code-split everything heavy (React Flow, syntax highlighter).

### Build → ship pipeline

```bash
cd dashboard && pnpm build
# → produces dashboard/dist/ (static files)

# FastAPI mount in FRONTEND/api/main.py:
app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory="dashboard/dist", html=True), name="dashboard")
```

`Dockerfile` adds a Node build stage:
```
FROM node:22-alpine AS dash-build
WORKDIR /dash
COPY dashboard/package.json dashboard/pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
COPY dashboard/ ./
RUN pnpm build
# … then copy dist/ into the Python image
```

### OpenAPI-driven typed client

FastAPI already publishes OpenAPI at `/openapi.json`. Generate the TS client at build time:
```bash
pnpm dlx openapi-typescript http://localhost:8000/openapi.json -o src/lib/api.d.ts
```

→ Every API change re-types the frontend automatically. No drift.

### Pages & features

**Scans (index)** — list of scans, status badges, search + filter, "New Scan" CTA
- Cards: repo · status · time · severity counts · attestation badge · go-to button

**Findings (`/runs/$id`)** — the meat
- Header: scan summary, OWASP heatmap, attestation download, SBOM download
- Filters bar: severity + category + min_confidence + reachability + taint + exploit_tier
- Table (virtualised with `@tanstack/react-virtual` for 10k+ findings):
  - Severity pill · rule_id · file:line · message preview · reachability badge · taint badge · exploit badge · click → modal
- **Finding modal** (the showstopper):
  - Tabs: Overview / Code / Taint Flow / Reasoning / Autofix / Exploit Proof
  - Overview: AI explanation rendered as markdown, confidence breakdown chart
  - Code: syntax-highlighted snippet with vulnerable line marked
  - Taint Flow: React Flow graph — source node → hops → sink node, clickable
  - Reasoning: Engine 3's reasoning chain as a step-by-step accordion
  - Autofix: side-by-side diff (react-diff-viewer-continued), "Apply" → opens auto-fix-PR flow
  - Exploit Proof: payload, response, container_id, "Re-verify" button

**Run-vs-run compare (`/runs/$id/compare`)** — dropdown to pick base scan, tabs: New / Fixed / Regressed / Unchanged

**Supply Chain (`/supply-chain`)** — dep tree, risk badges, click for CVE list + maintainer health, SBOM download

**Settings (`/settings`)** — §12 mode selector with live status panel, "Test current mode", "Sync OSV DB", "Pull Ollama model"

**Auth (`/auth/login`)** — JWT login, refresh token rotation, RBAC-aware navigation

### Persistent UI elements

- **Mode badge** in header: `🌐 Cloud Mode` / `🔒 Hybrid Mode` / `🛡️ Offline Mode` — always visible during demo
- **Dark/light toggle** with system preference detection
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** `⌘K` command palette (cmdk), `/` search, `j/k` next/prev finding, `Esc` close modal
- **Toast notifications** (Sonner) for scan completion, error states
- **Skeleton loaders** for every async card — no jank

### Non-functional acceptance

- Lighthouse: perf ≥ 90 / a11y ≥ 95 / best practices ≥ 95 / SEO ≥ 90
- Bundle first-paint < 300KB gzip
- Mobile responsive (Tailwind `md:`/`lg:`)
- Works in offline mode (only calls localhost)
- All API calls strictly typed from OpenAPI
- ≥40 component tests + ≥10 Playwright E2E flows

## 11.2b Phase B+ — Marimo Notebook (the defense weapon)

In parallel with the React dashboard, ship `notebooks/walkthrough.py` — a Marimo reactive notebook that walks through the entire pipeline cell by cell:

```
notebooks/
├── walkthrough.py      # full pipeline demo
├── engine_demos/
│   ├── taint.py        # Engine 1 deep dive
│   ├── exploit.py      # Engine 4 deep dive (existing)
│   ├── attestation.py  # Engine 5 deep dive
│   └── offline.py      # §12 offline mode proof
└── README.md
```

**Why Marimo over Jupyter:** reactive (no stale state), reproducible (just a `.py` file), git-friendly, runs as an app with `marimo run`.

**Cells in `walkthrough.py`:**
1. Load a vulnerable fixture file
2. Run static analysis → show raw findings
3. Apply normaliser → canonical schema
4. Apply reachability engine → reachable / dead-code split
5. Apply taint engine → show flow graph (Marimo supports rendering React Flow output)
6. Apply triage agent → show reasoning chain
7. Generate explanation (cloud OR offline — toggle widget)
8. Generate autofix → side-by-side diff
9. Verify exploit → Docker output capture
10. Sign attestation → display + verify
11. Generate SBOM + supply-chain risk
12. Final dashboard JSON ready for the API

Defense format: examiner runs the notebook, each cell takes <5s, the whole walkthrough is 5–8 minutes. Beats any slide deck.

**Acceptance:** notebook runs end-to-end with zero edits, link from `README.md`, also exported as static HTML in `docs/walkthrough.html` for offline viewing.

## 11.3 Phase C — Validation Track

### 11.3.1 Eval Repos Expansion (4 → 10)

| Repo | Language | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **OWASP NodeGoat** | JS | OWASP-owned, widely cited in academia |
| **OWASP Juice Shop** | TS | Modern JS/TS benchmark, examiners know it |
| **DVNA** | JS | Already partially in `DATA/sandbox/dvna/` — promote |
| **Tiredful-API** | Django | Broadens framework rule coverage |
| **bandit-test-cases** | Python | 109 labelled cases — recall floor measurement |
| **vulnerable-flask-app** | Python | Tiny — fast smoke + CI cycle |

For each: clone → ground-truth YAML in `TESTS/evaluation/ground_truth/<name>.yml` → recall test in `test_recall.py` → row in `EVALUATION.md`.

**DVPWA recall fix (50% → ≥80%):**
- Hardcoded password missed: verify Bandit B105 mapping, add custom Semgrep rule if needed
- Debug mode (`DEBUG=True`) missed: add Semgrep rule `python-debug-true`
- CSRF missed: add Semgrep rule for `app.config['WTF_CSRF_ENABLED'] = False`

### 11.3.2 Third-Party Audit Layer (9 free tools)

| Tool | Purpose | Wire-in |
|---|---|---|
| **Snyk** (free OSS) | Dep + SAST scanning | `.github/workflows/snyk.yml` — PR comment |
| **CodeQL** | Semantic SAST | `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` — weekly |
| **Dependabot** | Dep updates | `.github/dependabot.yml` |
| **GitGuardian** | Secret scanning | GitHub App install |
| **SonarCloud** | Code quality | `sonar-project.properties` + workflow |
| **Trivy** | Docker image scanning | workflow on Dockerfile change |
| **Codecov** | Coverage tracking | replace local `htmlcov/` |
| **Lighthouse CI** | Dashboard perf budget | workflow against deployed URL |
| **PostHog** (free 1M events/mo) | Dashboard analytics | `<script>` in `index.html` for user study |

### 11.3.3 Competitive Baseline — `docs/evaluation/COMPETITIVE_BASELINE.md`

Run Snyk + CodeQL + SonarCloud on the same 10 eval repos as ACR-QA. Build the table:

| Repo | ACR-QA Recall | ACR-QA FP | Snyk Recall | Snyk FP | CodeQL Recall | CodeQL FP | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

This is the thesis money-shot table. Story: "open-source tool at $0 cost matches Snyk on ≥6/10 repos and adds proof-of-exploit + taint + auto-fix-PR + signed attestations that nobody else has in one package."

---

## 11.4 Phase D — Cloud + Closeout

### 11.4.1 Cloud (parallel to engine work — do early so demos hit live URL)

- Railway deploy: `https://acr-qa.up.railway.app/health` returns 200
- Auto-deploy on merge: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Sentry free tier wired in `FRONTEND/api/main.py` — synthetic error visible in dashboard
- UptimeRobot 5-min polls on `/health` and `/metrics`
- Smoke test: real scan via deployed URL, attestation signed, persisted
- Fix `docs/setup/RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md` — replace `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` references with `JWT_SECRET_KEY`

### 11.4.2 User Study (start early — responses trickle in)

- Send `docs/evaluation/USER_STUDY_PROTOCOL.md` to 10–12 KSIU classmates
- Track in PostHog (`dashboard_loaded`, `finding_clicked`, `autofix_pr_opened`)
- Aggregate responses in `docs/evaluation/USER_STUDY_RESULTS.md` as they come

### 11.4.3 Demo Video (after dashboard is live)

- OBS Studio, 1920×1080, 5-min limit
- Script: `docs/DEMO_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md` (update for new engines)
- Shoot 3 takes max; upload to YouTube unlisted
- Add link to README + commit thumbnail to `docs/media/`

### 11.4.4 v4.0.0 Release

- `CHANGELOG.md` v4.0.0 entry covering all 5 engines + dashboard + validation
- `README.md` badges current
- `AGENT_NOTES.md` What's Left ✅ all done
- Tag `v4.0.0`, push, GitHub release with `COMPETITIVE_BASELINE.md` results in notes
- Blog post draft in `docs/BLOG_POST_DRAFT.md` — 1500 words, lead with the taint + auto-fix-PR combo
- Submit to Hacker News, r/Python, r/netsec when blog post publishes

## 11.5 Phase E — Comprehensive Testing Plan

Each new engine ships with its own unit tests, but the *system* needs new test layers too. Don't ship v4.0.0 until every layer is green.

### 11.5.1 Existing layers (preserved)

| Layer | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | `TESTS/test_*.py` — 1,979 tests | ✅ baseline |
| Integration | `TESTS/test_integration_benchmarks.py`, `test_celery_tasks.py` | ✅ |
| Recall battery | `TESTS/evaluation/test_recall.py` (4 repos) | ⚠️ expand to 10 |
| God-mode | `TESTS/test_god_mode.py` (96 tests) | ✅ baseline |
| Docker exploit | `TESTS/test_exploit_verifier.py` (`-m exploit`) | ✅ |

### 11.5.2 New layers to add

| Layer | Tool | What it tests | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Taint engine** | pytest | Source/sink/sanitizer/propagation | `TESTS/test_taint_analyzer.py` (~80 tests) |
| **Incremental scan** | pytest | git diff + reverse call-graph + cache | `TESTS/test_incremental.py` (~35 tests) |
| **Triage agent** | pytest + Groq mocks | Multi-step reasoning loop + cost guard | `TESTS/test_triage_agent.py` (~40 tests) |
| **Auto-fix PR** | pytest + GitHub API mocks + tempdir git | Diff apply, no-regression scan, PR open | `TESTS/test_autofix_pr.py` (~30 tests) |
| **Supply chain** | pytest + OSV mocks | Lockfile parsing, CVE lookup, risk math, SBOM schema | `TESTS/test_supply_chain.py` (~35 tests) |
| **E2E browser** | Playwright | Dashboard click-paths, modals, downloads | `TESTS/e2e/test_dashboard.py` |
| **Load** | Locust | p95 <500ms, error <1% under 50 RPS | `TESTS/load/locustfile.py` |
| **Dogfood** | pytest + ACR-QA itself | 0 HIGH in CORE/, no secrets, no eval/exec | `TESTS/test_dogfood.py` |
| **Live smoke** | pytest + httpx | Post-deploy poll of `/health`, `/metrics`, `/v1/runs` | `TESTS/test_live_smoke.py` |
| **Lighthouse** | `lhci` CLI | perf ≥90, a11y ≥95 on live URL | CI workflow |

**Test budget:** ~220 new tests on top of existing 1,979 → target **≥2,200 tests** at v4.0.0.

### 11.5.3 Third-party agreement tracker — `docs/evaluation/THIRD_PARTY_VALIDATION.md`

For each third-party tool, document agreement vs disagreement:

| Tool | Found | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Snyk | 0 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM | ✅ Agrees | Both MEDIUM also in our output |
| CodeQL | 1 HIGH | ❌ Disagrees | FP on test fixture; suppressed |
| GitGuardian | 0 secrets | ✅ | Confirms no committed keys |
| Trivy | 3 HIGH in deps | 🔄 Action | Bump pydantic, fastapi |
| SonarCloud | B rating | 🔄 Action | 12 maintainability issues |

This table is defence evidence: "Independent tools validate ACR-QA's findings."

### 11.5.4 Manual pre-release smoke

Before tagging v4.0.0, do these by hand once:

- [ ] Fresh clone → `make up` → working in <10 min
- [ ] `make seed-admin` → login on live URL works
- [ ] Run scan via dashboard → modal opens → reasoning chain visible → autofix-PR button works
- [ ] Trigger taint engine on `tainted_sqli.py` fixture → flow graph renders
- [ ] Trigger auto-fix PR (dry run) → diff bundle returned
- [ ] Download attestation → `verify_attestation.py` validates
- [ ] Download SBOM → CycloneDX schema valid (use `cyclonedx-cli validate`)
- [ ] All third-party CI jobs green
- [ ] Lighthouse ≥90 perf, ≥95 a11y
- [ ] Sentry: 0 unhandled errors last hour
- [ ] UptimeRobot: ≥99% since cloud went live

---

When all of the above are ✅ → tag `v4.0.0` → blog post live → thesis defensible at publishable level.

---

## 11.7 Execution Mode + Log

**How to invoke:** Ahmed says `go god mode <phase> <step>` (e.g. `go god mode A engine-1`) → agent reads the relevant subsection → executes top-to-bottom autonomously → commits per logical unit → pushes → updates the log table below at end of each session.

**Priority order (when in doubt):** Phase A engines 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 (each depends on previous), Phase B & C can run in parallel after engine 1, Phase D in parallel from the start (cloud should go up early), Phase E final gate.

### Execution Log

| Session | Date | Phase/Step | Commits | Tests added | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | |
| 6 | | | | | |
| 7 | | | | | |
| 8 | | | | | |

When all rows are filled and §11.6 is fully ✅ → `git tag v4.0.0` → publish blog post → submit thesis.

---

## 11.8 The Don't-Do List (PRO Edition)

These look appealing but would shred time without thesis value. Skip them all:

| Don't | Why |
|---|---|
| Inter-procedural taint analysis | v4.1 work. Intra-proc is already 3 weeks of effort. |
| Rewriting in TypeScript / Rust / Go | Procrastination. Python is correct. |
| K8s operator | Railway is enough for the live URL. |
| GraphQL API | REST + Swagger is more impressive than mediocre GraphQL. |
| Multi-tenancy enforcement | `workspace_id` FK stub is fine for thesis. |
| Java/PHP language support | Scope creep. Python+JS+TS is defensible. |
| VS Code extension v2 | MCP server already covers IDE integration. Skip. |
| Custom rule editor UI | YAML files are fine. Don't build a no-code editor. |
| Fine-tuning a custom LLM | Groq + RAG is the right level of AI. |
| Real-time collaborative review | Not a thesis claim. Skip. |
| Mobile native app | Web dashboard works on mobile (responsive pass is enough). |

---

*Plan §11 written May 14, 2026. Replaces the original 5-day compression. The 5 new engines + dashboard rebuild + validation track is what takes ACR-QA from "graded student project" to "publishable open-source platform." All §§0–10 preserved as foundation.*

# 12. Offline / Fully-Local Mode — Privacy-First Operation (Engine 6)

**Written:** May 14, 2026
**Status:** new — added to v4.0.0 PRO scope
**Why:** every commercial competitor (Snyk, CodeRabbit, Greptile, Semgrep Pro) requires sending source code to their cloud. Defense contractors, healthcare, finance, classified codebases, GDPR-strict EU shops *cannot use them*. ACR-QA shipping a verifiable "zero bytes leave your machine" mode is a moat no closed-source competitor can match.

## 12.0 Why This Exists

Three real customer profiles ACR-QA can win that no competitor can:
1. **Air-gapped environments** — classified gov / defense, can't reach any cloud at all
2. **Privacy-strict** — healthcare (HIPAA), finance (PCI), legal (privilege), EU (GDPR data residency)
3. **Cost-conscious** — students, indie devs, startups burning runway: $0 forever, no key, no signup

Even outside those, *most security engineers don't want to send their company's source to a third-party API* — they just don't have the political capital to fight for an alternative. Giving them one is the entire pitch.

The thesis chapter writes itself: *"ACR-QA is, to our knowledge, the first AI-augmented SAST platform with a verifiable air-gapped mode. We demonstrate full feature parity (explanation, triage, autofix suggestions, reachability, exploit verification) running entirely on a single laptop with no network access, validated via outbound-traffic capture."*

## 12.1 The Three Operational Modes — User Choice

Selected via `ACRQA_MODE` env var (and a settings page in the dashboard that writes to it):

| Mode | LLM | CVE lookup | GitHub API | Telemetry | Egress guard | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`cloud`** *(default)* | Groq | OSV.dev live | Live (autofix PRs) | Sentry + PostHog | Off | OSS projects, demos, public repos |
| **`hybrid`** | Groq (read-only) | OSV.dev live | Read-only (no PR opens) | Off | Off | Internal corp code, you trust Groq but not GitHub-bot writes |
| **`offline`** | Ollama (localhost:11434) | Bundled OSV snapshot | Disabled | Off | **Hard on** — refuses any non-localhost HTTP | Air-gapped, classified, regulated |

**Per-feature override:** every AI feature also has its own toggle so users can mix-and-match. E.g., `ACRQA_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` + `ACRQA_MODE=cloud` runs Ollama-local for AI but still talks to OSV.dev for CVEs.

### Per-feature flags (all default to enabled in `cloud`, disabled in `offline`)

| Flag | Default (cloud) | Default (offline) | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ACRQA_LLM_PROVIDER` | `groq` | `ollama` | Where AI calls go |
| `ACRQA_OLLAMA_URL` | — | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama endpoint |
| `ACRQA_LLM_MODEL` | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` | `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | Explanation model |
| `ACRQA_LLM_MODEL_FAST` | `llama-3.1-8b-instant` | `llama3.2:3b` | Feasibility model |
| `ACRQA_PATH_FEASIBILITY` | `1` | `1` | Path feasibility on/off (already exists) |
| `ACRQA_AI_DETECTION` | `1` | `1` | AI detection endpoint (already exists) |
| `ACRQA_AI_TRIAGE` | `1` | `1` | Multi-step triage agent (Engine 3) |
| `ACRQA_OSV_PROVIDER` | `live` | `local` | OSV.dev vs bundled snapshot |
| `ACRQA_GITHUB_INTEGRATION` | `1` | `0` | Auto-fix PR generator (Engine 4) |
| `ACRQA_TELEMETRY` | `1` | `0` | Sentry + PostHog |
| `ACRQA_OFFLINE_GUARD` | `0` | `1` | Hard-block non-localhost HTTP |

Single-knob default: `ACRQA_MODE` sets sensible defaults for all the above. Power users can override any individual flag.

## 12.2 Engine 6 — Local LLM Provider (Ollama integration)

**File:** `CORE/engines/ollama_provider.py`
**Interface:** same shape as existing `KeyPool` so the explainer doesn't care which backend it talks to.

**Recommended models** (let user pick via `ACRQA_LLM_MODEL`):

| Model | Size | Speed (CPU) | Quality | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | 4.7GB | ~15 tok/s on M1 | Best for code | **Default for offline** — beats Llama 3.1 8B on code benchmarks |
| `qwen2.5-coder:14b` | 8.4GB | ~7 tok/s on M1 | Closest to GPT-4 | If user has 16GB+ RAM |
| `deepseek-coder-v2:16b` | 9.5GB | ~6 tok/s | State-of-the-art OSS | Alternative for high-end machines |
| `llama3.1:8b` | 5GB | ~12 tok/s | General-purpose | Fallback if user already has it |
| `llama3.2:3b` | 2GB | ~30 tok/s | Fast, smaller | Recommended for path feasibility (small model is fine) |
| `phi3.5:3.8b` | 2.2GB | ~25 tok/s | Microsoft's tiny model | Cheap laptops |

**Setup commands the dashboard / docs walk the user through:**
```bash
# One-time install
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
ollama serve   # background, listens on :11434

# Then in .env
ACRQA_MODE=offline
```

**Implementation:**
- `OllamaProvider` class with `chat_completion(messages, model, max_tokens, temperature)` → calls `POST localhost:11434/api/chat`
- OpenAI-compatible response shape so no upstream code changes
- `is_available()` ping `/api/tags` on startup; if Ollama isn't running, log a clear error and fall back to "no AI" mode (existing KeyPool degradation already handles this)
- `KeyPool.__init__` reads `ACRQA_LLM_PROVIDER`: `groq` → existing, `agentrouter` → existing, `ollama` → new, `none` → empty pool (already handled)
- `explainer.py` `_explain_one_async` dispatches based on provider — Ollama uses streaming response parsing
- `path_feasibility.py` same — uses smaller model via `ACRQA_LLM_MODEL_FAST`
- `triage_agent.py` (Engine 3) same — tool-calling works via Ollama's function-calling support (Qwen2.5-coder supports it natively)

## 12.3 Local CVE Database — `CORE/engines/osv_offline.py`

For the supply-chain engine (Engine 5) to work offline:

- Bundle the OSV database via the `osv-scanner` project's offline mode OR use **`osv-offline`** Python package
- Daily snapshot job (`scripts/sync_osv_db.py`) downloads the OSV ZIP, extracts to `~/.cache/acrqa/osv-db/`
- `SupplyChainEngine` reads `ACRQA_OSV_PROVIDER`: `live` → HTTP, `local` → query SQLite snapshot
- DB size: ~500MB compressed, ~2GB uncompressed
- Update cadence: user-controlled (`acrqa osv-sync` CLI command). Stale-but-known beats hard-fail.

## 12.4 Network Egress Guard — `CORE/utils/egress_guard.py`

The privacy guarantee needs **enforcement**, not just trust:

- Monkey-patches `httpx.Client.send` and `requests.Session.send` when `ACRQA_OFFLINE_GUARD=1`
- Blocks any non-localhost target with `EgressBlockedError`
- Allowlist: `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`, any `host.docker.internal` (for Ollama in Docker)
- Logs every blocked attempt with the calling stack frame — turns silent privacy leaks into loud test failures
- Wired into `FRONTEND/api/main.py` startup if env var set

**Demo value:** turn off Wi-Fi, run a full scan, dashboard works, AI explanation appears, exploit verifies. Mic-drop moment.

## 12.5 Air-Gapped Install — `make offline-pack`

For users who literally can't `pip install` on the target machine:

```bash
# On internet-connected build machine
make offline-pack
# → produces acr-qa-offline-v4.0.0.tar.gz (~6GB):
#   - acr-qa source
#   - Python wheel mirror (all deps as .whl files)
#   - Ollama Linux binary + models pre-pulled
#   - OSV DB snapshot
#   - Postgres + Redis as standalone binaries (or docker-compose offline images)
#   - Setup script: ./install-offline.sh

# Transfer via USB / approved media to air-gapped machine
# On air-gapped machine
tar xzf acr-qa-offline-v4.0.0.tar.gz
cd acr-qa-offline-v4.0.0
./install-offline.sh
# → installs everything, starts services, prints local URL
```

Bonus: include the **GPG signature + SHA256 manifest** so an admin can verify nothing was tampered with in transit (closes the loop with Engine attestation work — same crypto, applied to the install bundle).

## 12.6 Privacy Guarantees Document — `docs/PRIVACY.md` (new)

Required for the thesis defense (and any enterprise sales conversation later):

**Per-mode disclosure table — what data goes where:**

| Data | `cloud` | `hybrid` | `offline` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source code snippets (for AI explanation) | Sent to Groq | Sent to Groq | Stays local (Ollama) |
| File paths | Sent to Groq | Sent to Groq | Stays local |
| Repo metadata (name, commit SHA) | Sent to Sentry + PostHog | Not sent | Not sent |
| Dependency names | Sent to OSV.dev | Sent to OSV.dev | Stays local (snapshot) |
| Runtime errors | Sent to Sentry | Not sent | Not sent |
| Dashboard usage events | Sent to PostHog | Not sent | Not sent |
| Findings DB | Local Postgres | Local Postgres | Local Postgres |
| AI explanation cache | Local Redis | Local Redis | Local Redis |

**Verification:** `TESTS/test_offline_mode.py` captures outbound network traffic via `aiohttp` test server interception. Asserts: in offline mode, total bytes sent to non-localhost = 0.

## 12.7 Dashboard — Mode Selector + Indicator

Settings page (new tab in dashboard):

```

## 12.8 Tests — `TESTS/test_offline_mode.py`

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `test_ollama_provider_chat_completion` | Mock Ollama endpoint, verify shape |
| `test_keypool_dispatches_to_ollama` | `ACRQA_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` → uses OllamaProvider |
| `test_explainer_works_with_ollama` | Full explanation flow against mocked Ollama |
| `test_path_feasibility_with_ollama` | Same for feasibility |
| `test_triage_agent_with_ollama` | Same for Engine 3 |
| `test_osv_offline_lookup` | `ACRQA_OSV_PROVIDER=local` returns same shape as live |
| `test_egress_guard_blocks_external` | `httpx.get("https://groq.com")` raises `EgressBlockedError` |
| `test_egress_guard_allows_localhost` | `httpx.get("http://localhost:11434")` works |
| `test_egress_guard_logs_attempts` | Blocked call gets logged with caller frame |
| `test_offline_mode_zero_egress` | Full scan in offline mode → 0 bytes outbound to non-localhost (network interception harness) |
| `test_mode_switching` | Runtime switch cloud → offline reloads provider |
| `test_dashboard_settings_persist` | POST `/v1/settings/mode` → reflected in next `/health` |

Target: ~40 new tests + 1 integration test that does a real full scan in offline mode with Ollama running (skipped if Ollama not installed; marked `@pytest.mark.offline`).

## 12.10 Why This Is The Strongest Thesis Card

The other engines (taint, incremental, triage agent, autofix PR, supply chain) all have OSS or commercial competitors who do roughly the same thing. *None of those competitors offer fully-local mode.* The closest is:

- **Semgrep CE** — local, but no AI explanation, no exploit verification, no attestations
- **Bandit** — local, but pattern-only, no AI, no triage, no autofix
- **CodeQL** — local execution but ships SARIF; no AI augmentation, no proof-of-exploit

ACR-QA in offline mode = *every v3.x and v4.x feature* (RAG explanation + reachability + learned suppression + exploit verifier + signed attestations + taint + incremental + AI triage + auto-fix-PR-diff + SBOM) running on a laptop, with cryptographic egress proof.

That's the headline. That's what gets the blog post on Hacker News and the paper through review.

---

*Section 12 written May 14, 2026. Engine 6 + the 3-mode user-selectable architecture is the ACR-QA differentiator no commercial competitor can match. Built on top of all §11 engines — the engines work in any mode; this just chooses where the AI calls and CVE lookups land.*

# 13. MASTER TASK LIST — Single Source of Truth

**This is the only checklist that matters.** Every task across §11 + §12 is here. When Ahmed asks "where are we?", read this section. When a task completes, check the box and commit. The next unchecked task at the top of the highest-priority phase is what's next.

**Status legend:** `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[-]` deferred / dropped
**Last sync:** May 14, 2026 (v3.6.2 baseline)

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation (Cloud + Observability) · runs in parallel from day 1

- [-] **0.1** Railway live deploy — `https://acr-qa.up.railway.app/health` returns 200 *(deferred — external service signup)*
- [x] **0.2** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — auto-deploy on merge to main, <5 min
- [x] **0.3** Sentry free tier wired in `FRONTEND/api/main.py`, synthetic error visible *(code done; set `SENTRY_DSN` env var when ready)*
- [-] **0.4** UptimeRobot 5-min polls on `/health` and `/metrics`, email alerts on *(deferred — external service signup)*
- [x] **0.5** Fix `docs/setup/RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md` — replace `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` → `JWT_SECRET_KEY`

- [-] **0.7** README badge: "Live URL" pointing at Railway deployment *(blocked on 0.1)*

## Phase 1 — Engine 1: Taint Analyzer MVP (the keystone — A3 and A4 depend on it)

> **Scope decision (May 14 2026):** MVP only. 5 sources + 3 sinks + no sanitizers. Intra-procedural, single function scope. Enough to claim "Snyk-level taint analysis" in the thesis; inter-procedural + sanitizer support is post-defense.

- [x] **1.2** `config/taint_sinks.yml` — 3 sinks: `execute(`, `eval(`, `subprocess.`
- [x] **1.3** `CORE/engines/taint_analyzer.py` — AST visitor, intra-procedural propagation
- [x] **1.4** Multi-hop tracking (assign / fstring / format / call / attr / subscript)
- [x] **1.5** Pipeline wiring in `CORE/main.py.run()` after Bandit, before reachability
- [x] **1.6** Alembic migration `0007` — `taint_source`, `taint_path`, `taint_confidence` columns
- [x] **1.7** DB methods in `DATABASE/database.py` for taint fields
- [x] **1.8** `GET /v1/runs/{id}/findings` returns taint fields
- [x] **1.9** 4 fixture files in `TESTS/fixtures/taint/`
- [x] **1.10** `TESTS/test_taint_analyzer.py` — ~40 tests
- [x] **1.11** Docs: `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` + ADR for taint engine

## Phase 2 — Engine 6: Offline Mode (privacy moat, also unlocks airplane-mode demo)

- [x] **2.1** `CORE/engines/ollama_provider.py` — OpenAI-compatible client to `localhost:11434`
- [x] **2.2** `KeyPool` dispatch: `ACRQA_LLM_PROVIDER` ∈ `{groq, agentrouter, ollama, none}`
- [x] **2.3** `explainer.py` works with Ollama (streaming response parse)
- [x] **2.4** `path_feasibility.py` works with Ollama via `ACRQA_LLM_MODEL_FAST`
- [x] **2.5** `CORE/engines/osv_offline.py` — bundled OSV CVE snapshot reader
- [x] **2.6** `scripts/sync_osv_db.py` — daily snapshot downloader
- [x] **2.7** `CORE/utils/egress_guard.py` — httpx + requests monkey-patch
- [x] **2.8** `ACRQA_MODE` single-knob — sets `cloud` / `hybrid` / `offline` defaults
- [x] **2.9** `Makefile` target `make offline-pack` produces installable bundle <8GB
- [x] **2.10** `docs/PRIVACY.md` — per-mode data-flow disclosure table
- [x] **2.11** `docs/setup/OFFLINE_SETUP.md` — Ollama install walkthrough
- [x] **2.12** `TESTS/test_offline_mode.py` — ~40 tests including real zero-egress assertion
- [-] **2.13** Demo recording: laptop in airplane mode, full scan + AI + exploit

## Phase 3 — Engine 3: AI Triage Agent (multi-step reasoning)

- [ ] **3.1** `CORE/engines/triage_agent.py` — `TriageAgent` class, 3-step loop
- [ ] **3.2** Tool functions: `get_imports`, `get_callers`, `get_function_body`, `grep`
- [ ] **3.3** Cost guard — max 4 tool calls per finding, 1500 tokens per step
- [ ] **3.4** Alembic migration `0008` — `triage_reasoning`, `triage_verdict`, `triage_confidence_delta`
- [ ] **3.5** Pipeline wiring in `CORE/main.py` after explainer

- [x] **8.13** `docs/evaluation/EVALUATION.md` — 10-repo table updated

## Phase 9 — Third-Party Audit Layer (validation track)

> **Scope decision (May 14 2026):** Keep the three tools that produce competitive comparison data (Snyk, CodeQL, SonarCloud) + two free automations (Dependabot, Codecov). Cut GitGuardian, Trivy, Lighthouse CI, PostHog — moved to post-defense parking lot.

## 13.2 THE Execution Order (authoritative — do exactly this)

This order is the single answer to "what's next." It's derived from three rules:
1. **Front-load moats** — taint + offline are the two biggest thesis differentiators; ship them early so everything else builds on them
2. **Measure as you build** — eval repos cloned early means every new engine gets recall numbers from day one, not at the end
3. **Defer the dashboard** — building UI against real engine output beats wiring mocks twice

**Strict sequential order (each phase is atomic — no splitting):**

### 1️⃣ Phase 0 — Foundation
**Why first:** Cloud must be live for Sentry/UptimeRobot/PostHog/demo video. Doesn't block engine work, but every later phase wants a live URL to validate against. Set it up once, forget it.
**Blocks:** nothing strictly, but unblocks: 10.5 (live smoke test), 11.3 (demo video shoots against live URL).

### 2️⃣ Phase 8 — Evaluation Expansion
**Why second:** Pure repo-cloning + ground-truth YAML writing. **Zero engine dependencies.** Doing this NOW means every engine in Phases 1-6 immediately has 10 benchmark repos to measure recall + FP rate against. Doing it last means you discover engine weaknesses with no time to fix them.
**Blocks:** Phase 9 (competitive baseline needs the repos).

### 3️⃣ Phase 1 — Engine 1: Taint Analyzer MVP ⭐ KEYSTONE
**Why third:** It's the brain upgrade — Snyk Code / Semgrep Pro level capability. Phase 3 (triage agent) leverages taint context. Building taint first means downstream engines get richer input.
**Blocks:** 3 (triage agent reasons over taint chains), 6.10 (TaintFlowGraph component).

### 4️⃣ Phase 2 — Engine 6: Offline Mode (privacy moat)
**Why fourth:** Second-biggest thesis differentiator. Wires `OllamaProvider` into existing `explainer.py` + `path_feasibility.py` — both already exist, so payoff is fast. The egress guard and OSV-offline DB are independent of all engines. Defer 2.13 (airplane-mode demo recording) to after Phase 6 (dashboard) since the dashboard needs to be done for a good demo.
**Blocks:** 5.3 (supply chain uses OSV-offline), 11.3 (demo video features offline mode).

### 5️⃣ Phase 5 — Engine 5: Supply Chain + SBOM
**Why fifth:** Reuses Phase 2's OSV-offline reader (built one phase earlier). Otherwise independent — doesn't need taint. Easy parallel win that adds the CycloneDX SBOM differentiator + dependency risk scoring. Quick momentum boost mid-plan.
**Blocks:** 6.16 (Supply chain tab), 10.4 (dogfood test scans our own deps).

### 6️⃣ Phase 3 — Engine 3: AI Triage Agent
**Why sixth:** Needs Phase 1 (reasons over taint chains) AND Phase 2 (uses `KeyPool` dispatch, works in cloud OR offline). Doing this after both means it ships with offline support built in — no rework.
**Blocks:** 6.11 (ReasoningChain component).

### 7️⃣ Phase 4 — Engine 4: Auto-Fix Patch Generator
**Why seventh:** Benefits from triage verdict (skip auto-fix on `likely-fp`). After Phase 3 = smarter patch decisions. Independent otherwise.
**Blocks:** 6.13 (AutofixDiff component button calls this endpoint).

### 8️⃣ Phase 6 — Dashboard PRO Rebuild
**Why eighth:** All 5 engines complete = real data to wire, zero stale mocks, no double-work. Dashboard is purely a *view* over the engines; building it last avoids rebuilding it three times as engines evolve. ~29 tasks, the heaviest single phase.
**Blocks:** 7 (Marimo demo also benefits from dashboard screenshots), 10.1-10.2 (Playwright needs the React app), 11.3 (demo video screencasts the dashboard).

### 9️⃣ Phase 9 — Third-Party Audit + Competitive Baseline
**Why ninth:** Needs Phase 8's 10 eval repos AND a stable codebase to point Snyk/CodeQL/SonarCloud at. Running these tools mid-development against changing engines = noisy reports. Running them after engines stabilize = clean comparison.
**Blocks:** 11.11 (release notes auto-include competitive baseline numbers).

### 🔟 Phase 10 — Testing Layers (target ≥2,200 tests)
**Why tenth:** Playwright E2E needs the React dashboard. Locust load needs all engines running. Dogfood test needs every engine to scan against. Live smoke needs the cloud deploy. All four prerequisites done = clean run.
**Blocks:** 11.7 (AGENT_NOTES "What's Left" can't be fully checked without testing layers done).

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Phase 7 — Marimo Notebook Walkthrough
**Why eleventh:** Demonstrates every engine cell-by-cell. Can only be written once every engine works end-to-end. Notebook becomes the defense walkthrough — strictly the second-to-last task.
**Blocks:** 11.3 (demo video can intercut Marimo cells), 11.13 (Hacker News post links the notebook).

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Phase 11 — Closeout (v4.0.0)
**Why last:** Demo video needs dashboard + Marimo + offline mode demo. User study needs live URL + dashboard. v4.0.0 tag needs everything. Release notes need competitive baseline. Cannot start until 0-10 are 100% green.

---

**Parallelization rule:** Don't multi-task across phases — each phase is short enough to finish in one session per logical unit. Sequential execution = clear "where are we", no merge conflicts on shared files (especially migrations, which must increment in order: 0007 → 0008 → 0009).

**Exception:** Phase 0 sub-tasks (Sentry, UptimeRobot signup) can run in literal background while you write engine code. They're DNS / dashboard clicks, not code.

**The arrow:** Whenever §13.1 progress snapshot shows the next phase ready, this is the answer to "what's next" — no judgment call needed.

## 13.3 Invocation

When Ahmed says one of these, do exactly that:

| Say this | Agent does |
|---|---|
| `where are we` | Read §13, report % complete + the "➡️ NEXT PHASE" pointer + next 3 unchecked tasks |
| `whats next` | Single next unchecked task from the current phase (no judgment — strict §13.2 order) |
| `go god mode phase N` | Execute all unchecked tasks in phase N top-to-bottom; commit per logical unit; check boxes; push at end; then update the "➡️ NEXT PHASE" pointer to N+1 in §13.2 sequence |
| `go god mode N.M` | Execute single task N.M; commit; check box; report |
| `go god mode` (no args) | Read the "➡️ NEXT PHASE" pointer; execute that whole phase until interrupted or done |
| `sync the plan` | Re-read repo state, mark any tasks now done, update §13.1 snapshot + "➡️ NEXT PHASE" pointer |

**After every task completes, the agent MUST:**
1. Commit the work with a meaningful message
2. Tick the box in §13 (use `[x]` for done)
3. Update §13.1 progress bar (the ASCII snapshot)
4. When a phase finishes 100%: update the "➡️ NEXT PHASE" pointer at the top of §13 to the next phase in §13.2's strict order

**No re-deriving the order.** §13.2 is authoritative. If a task is genuinely blocked (e.g. external API down), mark it `[-]` deferred and move to the next item in the same phase, NOT skip to a later phase.

## Post-Defense Parking Lot

> These features are **deliberately deferred**. They're real and worth building — just not needed for the thesis defense. Come back to them after June 2026.

### Engine 2 — Incremental / Differential Scanner (v4.1)

Original Phase 3 from the pre-May-14 plan. Cut because it requires Phase 1 taint as input, adds 7 tasks mid-stream, and the PR-latency story doesn't strengthen the thesis defense presentation.

**What it is:**
- `CORE/engines/incremental.py` — `IncrementalScanner.scan_diff(base_ref, head_ref)`
- Reverse call-graph traversal (reuse `reachability.py`)
- Redis cache layer: `file_hash → finding_list`, 30-day TTL
- Endpoint `POST /v1/scans/diff` with body `{repo, base_ref, head_ref}`
- PR comment template — `+ 3 new HIGH`, `- 2 fixed`
- Performance target: <8s on 50k LOC, 5 changed files (Locust benchmark)
- ~35 tests in `TESTS/test_incremental.py`

**Thesis claim (save for v4.1 paper):** *"PR scan latency reduced 7× via incremental analysis. Submission-blocking SLO p95 <10s achieved on 50k LOC repos."*

### Full Taint Sanitizer Support (v4.1)

The MVP taint engine ships with 5 sources + 3 sinks + no sanitizers. Post-defense:
- Add 8 sanitizers: `html.escape`, `bleach.clean`, `quote_plus`, parameterized queries, etc.
- Expand to 30 sources (Django, sys.argv, file reads, network sockets)
- Expand to 15 sinks (template injection, path traversal, pickle, YAML load, etc.)
- Inter-procedural propagation (cross-function taint flows)

### Auto-Fix PR Creation (v4.1)

The shipped Phase 4 generates a patch diff shown in the dashboard. Post-defense, wire it to GitHub:
- `PyGithub` or `httpx`-based GitHub API integration
- Clone → patch → validation re-scan → push branch → open PR with signed-by trailer
- Per-category PR grouping (SQL injection in one PR, XSS in another)
- SLSA attestation in PR comment
- Safeguards: no default-branch push, no `.github/workflows/*` mods, max 10 files / 100 LoC
- ~25 extra tests covering GitHub API mocking + tempdir git

### Third-Party Tooling Extras (v4.1)

Dropped from Phase 9 — none are needed for the competitive baseline story:
- **GitGuardian** GitHub App — secrets scanning
- **Trivy** `.github/workflows/trivy.yml` — Docker image CVE scanning
- **Lighthouse CI** `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml` — perf budget gate on live URL
- **PostHog** analytics `<script>` in dashboard — usage telemetry

### Dashboard Polish (v4.1+)

Phase 6 ships a clean, functional React dashboard. Post-defense extras:
- Keyboard shortcuts (cmdk command palette + `j/k` navigation)
- Full mobile responsive pass
- Lighthouse audit ≥90 perf / ≥95 a11y
- Dark/light mode persistence in localStorage

### ⭐ Fine-Tuned Security Explanation Model (v4.1 — if time permits)

> **Status:** Optional. Add to Phase 11 closeout as a stretch task if Phase 0–10 finish early.

**What:** Fine-tune a small model specifically on ACR-QA scan data so the offline mode uses a security-specialized LLM instead of a general-purpose one.

**Why it's strong:** Snyk Code and Semgrep Assistant are quietly working toward domain-adapted models. None have published a downloadable fine-tune. ACR-QA would be the first open-source scanner with a published security-explanation model.

**How:**
1. Use Groq free tier to generate ~1,000–2,000 high-quality `(finding → explanation)` pairs across the 10 eval repos
2. Fine-tune `qwen2.5-coder:1.5b` or `codellama:7b` via QLoRA (runs on free Colab T4 or laptop GPU)
3. Publish adapter on HuggingFace as `acr-qa/security-explainer-v1`
4. Wire as default model when `ACRQA_MODE=offline` — replaces the generic Ollama model

**Thesis claim:** *"ACR-QA ships a domain-adapted security explanation model fine-tuned on 2,000 real vulnerability findings. In offline mode, this replaces the general-purpose LLM, producing rule-citing explanations with higher self-eval scores at zero inference cost."*

**Estimated effort:** 2–3 days (data collection 1 day, fine-tune + eval 1 day, integration 0.5 day).

**Risk:** If fine-tuned model scores lower than base model on unseen findings, that's an awkward thesis result. Mitigate by publishing comparison data honestly — "fine-tune wins on in-distribution findings, base model wins on novel patterns" is still a valid finding.
